To build the Niue source code, you need JDK 1.5 (or later) and the Apache 
Ant (http://ant.apache.org/) build system. 

Take a command shell, cd to the same directory as this INSTALL file and run 
`ant'. This will create a new folder `classes' with all the compiled class files. 
If you need a jar file, run `ant jar'.
